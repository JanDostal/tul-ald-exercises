## Description

- These are individual exercises that I have been working on independently in the university course concerning abstract data structures (Queue, Stack, Doubly linked list, Binary tree, AVL tree, Graph) and problem-solving (Palindrom, Working with strings, Regex)
- The exercises consist of .NET programs written in C#, so to run them C# compiler needs to be installed
- The exercises were submitted to Code Critic, which is provided by TUL

## Info about work process regarding exercises

- Exercises were uploaded sequentially to this repository from Code Critic
